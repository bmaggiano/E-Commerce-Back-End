# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

An ecommerce platform is arguably the most popular of web applications to show case an individuals understanding of relational databases and being able to dynamically add/update/delete information across multiple tables. This web application allows users to input products, update those products, add categories to those products, add tag ids to those products, delete products/categories/tags, and update all of the afforementioned data. 

This is done with Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL2.0, and also protects important data by hiding the database info inside a .env file for added protection. Please see the video walkthroughs and installation instructions to see how this app could help you with your ecommerce needs.

## Credits

Using MySQL2.0 to add the tables to our application (navigate to db folder, open in integrated terminal, use SOURCE schema.sql; and then USE ecommerce_db; to get started).

To download dependencies for this application (navigate out of db into the main folder and run npm i).

To see the database with basic product info/category info/tag info (run the command npm run seed).

To finally run the server (run the command node server). 

We also will be using Insomnia to show case the json data being translated behind the scenes.
